# Maze Playground
Experimental maze page which visualises some different maze generation and solution algorithms. 

[Click here](https://consolelogreece.github.io/MazePlayground/) for live version.

## Generation Algorithms: 
1. Cellular Automata
2. Eller's
3. Hunt and Kill 
4. Randomized Prim's
5. Recursive backtrack
6. Recursive division 
7. Tree growing

## Solving Algorithms:
1. Breadth first
2. Dead end filler
3. Random mouse
4. Recursive backtrack
5. Tr√©maux
6. Wall flower

Notes: 
- All algorithms were are designed for easy visualisation, and as such, they lose a good deal of performance.
- All drawing is done manually on a canvas.
